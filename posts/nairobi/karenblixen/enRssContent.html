<p>After 1.5 months in Yaoundé, Cameroon, I moved to Keyna the other day. I didn't know what to expect from the eastern part of Africa, but it's been a pleasant surprise. Maybe the fresh and crisp mornings, maybe the easiess of being able to do anything in English, maybe the easy access to nature, I don't know, but I have been loving and absorbing everything I encounter here in Nairobi.</p>
<p>As I always do, I stared composing some useful information to understand urbanism and arhchiecture scene here in Nairobi. This is a personal archive, so I'll keep updating the list as I learn more.</p>

<p><a href="https://africainwords.com/2020/11/19/a-review-of-nairobi-noir-a-collection-of-short-stories-edited-by-peter-kimani/">Nairobi Noir</a> is a collection of short stories edited by Peter Kimani, and it as been helping me to understand this massive city better through stories. A story, to me, is the best way to get to know &amp; relate to a place, and I have been learning about varios areas of the city of which I wouldn't know much otherwise. I especially enjoyed the work by Winfred Kiunga about Eastleigh, where many Somali people live. I learned how Somali regugees are mistreated here in Nairobi, especially by the polices, through this story. Definitely worth a read.</p>
