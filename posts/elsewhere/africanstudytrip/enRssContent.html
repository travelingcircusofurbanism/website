<h2>Call for participants</h2>
<p>Urban development trip in Africa <strong>October 2021 — July 2022</strong><br>
<strong>Democracy Studio &amp; for Cities</strong> collaborating with Traveling Circus of Urbanism</p>
<p>The African continent will host one-third of the world population in the next generation and went these last years through social, economical, and environmental transformations at a spectacular size and speed. Julien Carbonnell (<a href="https://amzn.to/3xeNhOm">Democracy Studio</a>) and Mariko Sugita (<a href="https://www.forcities.org/">for Cities</a>) collaborate through the Traveling Circus of Urbanism to explore the African urban development and digital transformation by joining different local projects and providing a temporary workforce to accelerate their achievements.</p>
<p>To do so, <strong>we are gathering a small team of international urban practitioners with complementary skills willing to experience the urban practices in Africa from the field</strong>, in a trip of 8 to 10 months (flexible). Our mission aims to showcase what makes African cities vibrant nowadays and will be directly exploited by the participants in a free collaboration fashion through book(s), video documentary, educational programs, digital content, and other independent opportunities to build together…</p>
