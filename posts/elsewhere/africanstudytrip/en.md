## Call for participants

Urban development trip in Africa **October 2021 - July 2022**
**Democracy Studio & for Cities** collaborating with Traveling Circus of Urbanism

The African continent will host one-third of the world population in the next generation and went these last years through social, economical, and environmental transformations at a spectacular size and speed. Julien Carbonnell ([Democracy Studio](https://amzn.to/3xeNhOm)) and Mariko Sugita ([for Cities](https://www.forcities.org/)) collaborate through the Traveling Circus of Urbanism to explore the African urban development and digital transformation by joining different local projects and providing a temporary workforce to accelerate their achievements.

To do so, **we are gathering a small team of international urban practitioners with complementary skills willing to experience the urban practices in Africa from the field**, in a trip of 8 to 10 months (flexible). Our mission aims to showcase what makes African cities vibrant nowadays and will be directly exploited by the participants in a free collaboration fashion through book(s), video documentary, educational programs, digital content, and other independent opportunities to build together…

PROGRAM (flexible: no need to be part of all, can participate on shorter-term):

- Oct/Nov ’21: Cape Town, South Africa. Collaboration with [The Civic Tech Innovation Network](http://civictech.africa) a platform wiling to index, organise and boost the African civic technologies and civil participation in decision-making for the future of the continent.
- Dec/Jan ’22: Lomé, Togo. Collaboration with [L'africaine d'architecture](http://lafricainedarchitecture.com) on the project HubCité. Fab-lab in Lomé organizing a food waste collection to compost it and redistribute it in family gardens in the neighborhood. The gardens are equipped with sensors of the soil moisture which are shared on a digital map, giving the state of dryness/water in the city. The mission will consist in creating educational support (video tutorials and craft books) to educate the population in handling the issue.
- Fev/Mar ’22: Douala, Cameroon. Collaboration with [geo.sm](https://geo.sm/) an open data platform and local social network establishing digital maps and GIS in Africa, creating the infrastructure for interaction of inhabitants by geo-locations. In interaction with the new urban innovation lab DiverCity, we will work on existing datasets, both on the analysis and the valorisation of it to a mainstream audience.
