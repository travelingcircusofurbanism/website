### Things to do, places to go（おすすめスポット）

1. LAといえば、やはりアート。ダウンタウンに散らばるアート作品を巡る[Art Walk](http://downtownartwalk.org/)がおすすめ。他にアート系で王道であれば、[HAUSER & WIRTH](https://www.hauserwirth.com/locations/10069-hauser-wirth-los-angeles)や[Art Share L.A.](https://artsharela.org/)なども。

2. A public program that lets people to build a community parklet easily: [People St program](https://www.fastcompany.com/3026002/diy-kits-to-help-build-your-own-mini-park-anywhere-there-is-space-on-the-street?partner=rss)

3. A 10-year economic development and revitalization initiative to get an identity back to the city. [Bringing Back Broadway](https://bringingbackbroadway.com/)

4. An interesting project that brought the nature back to the former-industrial, challenged area. [Augustus F. Hawkins natural park](https://www.laparks.org/reccenter/augustus-f-hawkins-natural)

5. 黒人の建築家は、残念なことに未だに少ない。[Curbedの記事]((https://la.curbed.com/maps/los-angeles-black-architects-projects-map))に、LAにある黒人建築家が設計した建物がまとめられているのでおすすめ

7.  A world-renowned independent architecture schools, and it often has exhibition that is open to the public. [GALLERIES AT SCI-ARC](https://sciarc.edu/events/exhibitions)

### Read

10. I found this beautiful book at a book store in Art Share L.A.:[Sidewalking: Coming to Terms with Los Angeles](https://www.amazon.com/Sidewalking-Coming-Terms-Los-Angeles/dp/0520273729/ref=la_B001HD3GQO_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530294824&sr=1-6) written by David L. Ulin - it is his journey of trying to 'make sense' of the city. His another book of L.A. looks equaly interesting too: [Writing Los Angeles: A Literary Anthology](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Los-Angeles-Anthology-Publication/dp/1931082278)

11. Get to know the overall picture of [what is happening in LA](https://www.planetizen.com/tag/los-angeles)

12. Very helpful [resources](http://planning.lacity.org/urbandesign/resources/DowntownDesignGuide.php) to understand urban design principals in LA

13. I spent hours to check out Curbed's all [mapping projects](https://la.curbed.com/maps) - it's a great way to get to know LA from various perspective. Especially these urban-renewal related mapping projects are helpful to check a slew of new developments that's is coming/happening to some neighborhood.
- [Mapping the changes on Westlake’s horizon](https://la.curbed.com/maps/westlake-development-hotels-mixed-use-construction)
- [Changes underway in Chinatown, mapped](https://la.curbed.com/maps/chinatown-development-gentrification-map)
- [Mapping the Arts District's never-ending parade of development](https://la.curbed.com/maps/arts-district-los-angeles-development-map-2)

14. LAを舞台にした映画、[チャイナタウン](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)) (1974)はおすすめ。チャイナタウンと言いながら、チャイナタウンが舞台な訳ではなく、アナロジー的に使用されている。[この記事](http://www.laweekly.com/arts/chinatown-is-the-story-of-white-supremacy-and-gentrification-in-la-8333951)には、中国人の表象に対する批判と、LAのジェントリフィケーションについて、この映画を読み解きながら書かれていて、おすすめ。

15. Activist and journalist Alissa Walker's [blog](http://www.awalkerinla.com/) is a great introduction to the city and it makes wanna walk L.A.  

### Organization

15. Skid Row（スキッド・ロウ）は、路上生活者や薬物中毒者が約15,000人集まり生活するエリア。ダウンタウンからもほど近く、「LAで最も危険なエリアのひとつ」とも言われている。

[Skid Row Housing Trust](http://skidrow.org/) is a great initiative that provides permanent supportive housing for people who need supports. For those who are not familiar with Skid Row area, watch this short [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTJWdtX90C0).  

16. [Do ArT Foundation](http://doartfoundation.org/), a non-profit social enterprise created to produce publicArt programs, projects and exhibitions.

16. [L.A. Forum for Architecture and Urban Design](http://laforum.org/) is an independent nonprofit organization and organizes public programming, exhibitions, and publications. I went to one of their event "[TRANSFORMING THE CITY FROM INSIDE OUT // L.A. & TAIPEI CITY](http://laforum.org/event/adu-2-0-transforming-the-city-from-inside-out-l-a-taipei-city/)" and it was quite interesting.
