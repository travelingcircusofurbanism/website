![](douala.jpg)

On international woman's day, I visited Douala.

###

I arrived in Douala in a late evening. I was exhausted, a bit tired of the new envoronment, and didn't know where to go out and eat. While idoly browsing a google map, one place somehow caught my eye - [The Forest Creative Loft](https://www.theforestcreativeloft.com/). I browsed some pictures from the review and immeditely knew I have to see this place during my stay.

### Other things to know about Douala

- In Douala, a city 3 hours away by car from Yaound√©, a technology startup [Clinic Agro](https://clinicagro.net/) created a kit with a mobile application called Clinic Sol for instant soil testing and analysis for farming efficiency. Based on [the map](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC91922#:~:text=Soils%20such%20as%20Luvisols%20) of the major soil types of Africa, Cameroon has a high concentration of soil variety compared to the other parts of the continent. Since I came to Cameroon, I became more aware of the soil types. Check also the [Soil Atlas of Africa](https://croplife.org/news/soil-atlas-of-africa/).

- [Colonial architecture in Douala](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337950721_MEANINGS_AND_SIGNIFICANCE_OF_COLONIAL_ARCHITECTURE_IN_DOUALA_CAMEROON) is an interesting topic to dive into. There are some projects to support the preservation of this architecture, but of course, opinions are divided.
