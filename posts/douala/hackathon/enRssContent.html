<p>On international woman's day, I visited Douala.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>I arrived in Douala in a late evening. I was exhausted, a bit tired of the new envoronment, and didn't know where to go out and eat. While idoly browsing a google map, one place somehow caught my eye — <a href="https://www.theforestcreativeloft.com/">The Forest Creative Loft</a>. I browsed some pictures from the review and immeditely knew I have to see this place during my stay.</p>

<p>In Douala, a city 3 hours away by car from Yaoundé, a technology startup <a href="https://clinicagro.net/">Clinic Agro</a> created a kit with a mobile application called Clinic Sol for instant soil testing and analysis for farming efficiency. Based on <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC91922#:~:text=Soils%20such%20as%20Luvisols%20">the map</a> of the major soil types of Africa, Cameroon has a high concentration of soil variety compared to the other parts of the continent. Since I came to Cameroon, I became more aware of the soil types. Check also the <a href="https://croplife.org/news/soil-atlas-of-africa/">Soil Atlas of Africa</a>.</p>
