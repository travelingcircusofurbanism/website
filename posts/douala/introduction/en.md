# Places where I feel safe - visiting art & design spaces in Douala, Cameroon

![](douala.jpg)

On 8 March 2022, on international woman's day, I visited Douala. It's the largest city in Cameroon and its economic capital, while Yanoudé is more about administrative center. It about 230 km south from Yaoundé, and has a large indrtsrial port and an international airport.

While I absoltely got overwhelmed by the toasty weather and cramped streets packed with people and cars, I loved it every single minute I spent in it, thanks to the wonderful encounters I had in some of the art & design spaces there.

- I arrived in Douala in a late evening. I was exhausted, a bit tired of the new envoronment, and didn't know where to go out for dinner. While idoly browsing a google map, one place somehow caught my eye - [The Forest Creative Loft](https://www.theforestcreativeloft.com/). I browsed some pictures from the review and immeditely knew I have to see this place during my stay.

I have to admit - it was hard to find it, and I almost gave up - especially when I got lost in a loop in between the dark alleies and people calling me out of curiousity. Once I finally found a way to the entrance, I immidietely knew that I would even live there. The Forest Creative Loft is

Culture is a basic need

- [Doual'art](http://doualart.org/) is probably the most known art space in Douala, and it was my first destination a morning after I arrived. It's a welcoming space with satisfying yet not exchauting amount of collections, mainly by emerging African artists. People were welcoming too, and I am glad to be able to speak with one of the curators, who tought us other art spaces to visit in the city. Without her reccomendation, my stay in Douala wouldn't have been the same at all. It's always nice to ask.

- [Galerie MAM](https://www.galeriemamdouala.com/) was a serene,

- I will never forget how inviting and empowering [Bolo l'Espace Art & Culture](https://www.facebook.com/artetcultureBolo/) was. When I arrived at the gallery, the curator herself and two artists who're currently exhibiting thier works were there, all of whom were curious to know a mysterious east asian girl who showed up unannounced (me). They told me everything about thier work, thier space, thier philosophy, over a glass of fresh juice they offered, and we spoke briefly about African feminism, politics and identities of the non-west. It somehow felt like I knew them for a long time,

- [Annie Kadji Art Gallery](https://www.instagram.com/anniekadjiart/?hl=en) is a Douala based Art Gallery, showcasing African creativity, and it was my last destination of that day, and I was fortunate enough to talk to the owner & curator of the place. He is a Yoga teach er too, who have lived in the U.S. for years before coming back to Cameroon to take over the art space from his mother.

### Other things to know about Douala

- In Douala, a city 3 hours away by car from Yaoundé, a technology startup [Clinic Agro](https://clinicagro.net/) created a kit with a mobile application called Clinic Sol for instant soil testing and analysis for farming efficiency. Based on [the map](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC91922#:~:text=Soils%20such%20as%20Luvisols%20) of the major soil types of Africa, Cameroon has a high concentration of soil variety compared to the other parts of the continent. Since I came to Cameroon, I became more aware of the soil types. Check also the [Soil Atlas of Africa](https://croplife.org/news/soil-atlas-of-africa/).

- [Colonial architecture in Douala](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337950721_MEANINGS_AND_SIGNIFICANCE_OF_COLONIAL_ARCHITECTURE_IN_DOUALA_CAMEROON) is an interesting topic to dive into. There are some projects to support the preservation of this architecture, but of course, opinions are divided.
