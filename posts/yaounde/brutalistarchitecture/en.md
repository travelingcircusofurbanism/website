# Working on Africa's first spatial intelligence

## Geo.sm family

[Geo.sm](https://geo.sm/) is an open data platform and local social network establishing digital maps and GIS in Africa, creating the infrastructure for interaction of inhabitants by geo-locations.

## What we'll work on

## Meet the team

Through Traveling Circus of Urbanism, Julien and I have made [an open call](https://www.travelingcircusofurbanism.com/elsewhere/africanstudytrip) for participants to join our African exploration trip. Around 30 urbanists with different skillset from across the world have applied, and among the succesufl candidates, two members from Russia have joined our team. Here is the list of our international team of Traveling Circus of Urbanism.

She graduated from 4CITIES’ Euromaster in Urban Studies, which brought her to 4 cities in various countries across Europe (Brussels, Vienna, Copenhagen, and Madrid). After graduation, she has cultivated a trajectory completing connections between journalism and the fields of architecture and urban design. After a few years of working as an Urban Project Director in Loftwork.inc in Tokyo, she struck out as an independent agent. She owns the website Traveling Circus of Urbanism, and manages the cultural space Bridge To in Kyoto where she hosts an “urbanist in residence” program, and co-founded "for Cities", a new urban experience design studio based in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Amsterdam in 2021. She also organizes various workshops and educational programs and works as a curator. She is passionate about exploring and documenting stories of cities and the people who make them, in all parts of the world.

Urban scientist focus on civic technologies and smart-cities, I started my career as a real estate developer in the south of France, after graduation in psychology. Early attracted by the potential of the internet to co-design urban projects with neighboring inhabitants, I built my experience of citizen engagement by participating in many local projects from various perspectives: business, non-profits, innovation, think tank. I finally joined an academic research laboratory to strengthen my field observations with a scientific establishment and data analysis. I used this opportunity to build predictive models in Python, including machine learning and computer simulations. I keep traveling as a digital nomad, confront my theories to new case studies, grow my international network, and challenge my knowledge with new experiences.
