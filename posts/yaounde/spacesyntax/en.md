# Understanding Space Syntax, and how we plan to apply it in African context

## A russian doing spatial analysis in Africa

Talking about Eliza

1. it gives an concice definition of urban space
2. a family of techniqees for analysing cities as the network of space, formed by the placing, grouping, orientatino of buildings
3. a set of techniques for correlating networks of space to socio-economic data (such as movement, land use, area differentiation, migration patterns, social wellbeing and malaise)
4. a set of thories about how urban space networks relate in general to social factors, economic factorsl cognitive factors

## What space syntax is about, and why is it important

As an introduction of Space Syntax, [Spatial Morphology Group](https://www.smog.chalmers.se/) is a good start. The Spatial Morphology Group is engaged in urban research within the fields of urban morphology, space syntax and design theory. The focus is on the city's form and spatial structure and its impact on human behaviour but also on urban processes such as segregation, local markets and ecosystems.

Space Syntax is a tool for urban planners to understand how and what urban segments connect with other segments. It helps us to understand, for instance, how many roads with we can built in relation to different segments of urban nextwork.

Spatial Morphology Group provides [Place Syntax Tool](https://www.smog.chalmers.se/pst), which is an open source tool for performing spatial analyses. It combines the space syntax description of the urban environment with conventional descriptions of attraction into the combined accessibility analysis tool PST.

## How can we use it?

It is currently available as a plugin within GIS softwares.

barrette university london also created a tool to enable QGIS without using any programming skill.

Download it, open it with GIS software, and read the methodology from [this document](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354118033_PST_Documentation_v323_20210708) published by Place Syntax Tool

## Successful use of space syntax

in Russia
How tourists can move around the city centre - we used the inforation from booking.com and information about touristic places - objects of interets - with pedestrian nextwork of Moucko - and culcurate which streets are more croweded which roads should be used altehrnatively

## Applying in the African context
