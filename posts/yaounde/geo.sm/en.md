# Working with Africa's first spatial intelligence

![](geo.sm.jpg)

Last year, Julien Carbonnell from the [Democracy Studio](https://amzn.to/3xeNhOm) and I had organised an open call to form a team of international urbanists of different skillsets to explore the African urban development and digital transformation. The idea is to join various local projects that are open to collaboration, providing a temporary workforce as well as developing our own origianl projects with them.

Our circus has visited South Africa and Togo already, and as a third chapter, we've arrived in the capital city of Cameroon, Yaoudé at the beginnig of Feburary. Two new memebers join us from Russia, and we've started our collaboration with a local startup called geo.sm.

## Our collaboration in Cameroon

[Geo.sm](https://geo.sm/) is an open data platform and local social network establishing digital maps and GIS in Africa, creating the infrastructure for interaction of inhabitants by geo-locations.

## What we'll work on

We'll be mainly working on the following things during the 2 months of collaboration.

- Machine learning

- Business model

- Deisgn research

- Organizing 3 days Hackathon

## Meet the team

Through Traveling Circus of Urbanism, Julien and I have made [an open call](https://www.travelingcircusofurbanism.com/elsewhere/africanstudytrip) for participants to join our African exploration trip. Around 30 urbanists with different skillset from across the world have applied, and among the succesufl candidates, two members from Russia have joined our team. Here is the list of our international team of Traveling Circus of Urbanism.

Executive coach with enterpreneurial background. I have Master's degree in international law and started my career as a tax consultant for oil&gas in Big-4.Being fascinated by global projects and opportunities provided by technologies, I've built my own data science company and had a chance to help businesses from different industries in their growth by making data-driven decisions. That experience helped me to build burnout-preventing product which brought me to the US where I also represented electric cars startup as a CPO/COO.

Currently my main occupation is coaching for startup founders and product consulting. Having broad experience in product development and world-wide collaborations, I'm deeply interested in creating new product decisions and implementing international best practices into African business landscape.

Mariko is an independent editor, journalist, and researcher on architecture and urbanism. She graduated from 4CITIES’ Euromaster in Urban Studies, which brought her to 4 cities in various countries across Europe (Brussels, Vienna, Copenhagen, and Madrid). After graduation, she has cultivated a trajectory completing connections between journalism and the fields of architecture and urban design. After a few years of working as an Urban Project Director in Loftwork.inc in Tokyo, she struck out as an independent agent. She owns the website Traveling Circus of Urbanism, and manages the cultural space Bridge To in Kyoto where she hosts an “urbanist in residence” program, and co-founded "for Cities", a new urban experience design studio based in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Amsterdam in 2021. She also organizes various workshops and educational programs and works as a curator. She is passionate about exploring and documenting stories of cities and the people who make them, in all parts of the world.

Urban scientist focus on civic technologies and smart-cities, I started my career as a real estate developer in the south of France, after graduation in psychology. Early attracted by the potential of the internet to co-design urban projects with neighboring inhabitants, I built my experience of citizen engagement by participating in many local projects from various perspectives: business, non-profits, innovation, think tank. I finally joined an academic research laboratory to strengthen my field observations with a scientific establishment and data analysis. I used this opportunity to build predictive models in Python, including machine learning and computer simulations. I keep traveling as a digital nomad, confront my theories to new case studies, grow my international network, and challenge my knowledge with new experiences.

Urbanist and GIS analyst. My role in such urban development projects as masterplanning, creation of new public spaces or parks is to conduct a complex urban analysis. Most often, such an analysis includes creation of population density heat maps, determination of the main urban planning restrictions along with analysis of the current territory use and modeling or forecasting of pedestrian routes. This analysis is used by city administration and architectural bureaus in order to better understand the territory in the context of the whole city and make informed decisions on development of the territory.

A year and a half ago, I started working as Head of Development team for the largest housing developer in Russia. My knowledge of urban data and various methods of automating work using GIS methods helped me develop a new system. It makes possible to evaluate land plots with regard to how attractive they are for housing construction, to collect data on already analyzed land plots and show those land plots, which are currently being sold, and many other tools that made the work of the analytics team faster.

I'm eager to research how the methodologies that I use to analyze Russian cities can be applied and transferred to the analysis of African cities.
