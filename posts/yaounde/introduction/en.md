# Urbanist's Guide to Yaundé, Cameroon

![]()

Here I am - as a third chapter of the African urban exploration of Traveling Circus of Urbanism, I came to the capital city of Cameroon, Yaundé! The city spreads over 7 hills, and after being a geographically flat city like Lomé, it feels absolutely refreshing to obserb the wavy patterns of the landscapes. There is something mysterious and appealing about hilly cities.

Here, I'm collaboraing with [geo.sm](https://geo.sm/), an open data platform and local social network establishing digital maps and GIS in Africa, creating the infrastructure for interaction of inhabitants by geo-locations. I'll report more about geo.sm and thier wonderful initiatives, but for now, as always, I'm archiving my basic research on urban happenings of Yaundé here.
