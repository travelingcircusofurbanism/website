<p>Here I am — as a third chapter of the African urban exploration of Traveling Circus of Urbanism, I came to the capital city of Cameroon, Yaundé! The city spreads over 7 hills, and after being a geographically flat city like Lomé, it feels absolutely refreshing to obserb the wavy patterns of the landscapes. There is something mysterious and appealing about hilly cities.</p>
<p>Here, I'm collaboraing with <a href="https://geo.sm/">geo.sm</a>, an open data platform and local social network establishing digital maps and GIS in Africa, creating the infrastructure for interaction of inhabitants by geo-locations. I'll report more about <a href="http://geo.sm">geo.sm</a> and thier wonderful initiatives, but for now, as always, I'm archiving my basic research on urban happenings of Yaundé here.</p>
