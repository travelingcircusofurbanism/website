# Humasn of Lomé: the HubCitizen Project

Traveling Circus of Urbanism is a platform for urban narratives that are collected from the world through traveling and dialogues with the citizens of the world. In Lomé, as a collaboration with WoeLab, I was interested in discovering the stories and empirical dataset on/of the streets to highlight the users of the HubCity project by WoeLab. During my stay, I've dedicated my time to face-to-face interviews and photo shooting with (potential) users and people in the neighborhood, as well as conducting participatory surveys. This is how I came up with [the HubCitizen project](https://main--helix--mariko9012.hlx3.page/).

the HubCitizen project is like [Humans of New York](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/). I spent time photographing people on the streets and highlighted thier short stories and their lives alongside their portraits, creating a catalogue of the city’s inhabitants.

I built a website by uding a new CMS system called [Helix](https://www.hlx.live/), which allows us to do a content management easily via Google Drive. It is such a powerful tool to build experiences through Google Drive with little-to-no training required, so that website can be edited and updated easily by anyone at WoeLab even after I leave. I have chosen the vertical column structure for easy view. All the codes are publicly shared and accessible on [my Github](https://github.com/mariko9012/helix).

You can watch a summary of what the HubCitizen project is about on the presentation video.
