<p>Traveling Circus of Urbanism is a platform for urban narratives that are collected from the world through traveling and dialogues with the citizens of the world. In Lomé, as a collaboration with WoeLab, I was interested in discovering the stories and empirical dataset on/of the streets to highlight the users of the HubCity project by WoeLab. During my stay, I've dedicated my time to face-to-face interviews and photo shooting with (potential) users and people in the neighborhood, as well as conducting participatory surveys. This is how I came up with <a href="https://main--helix--mariko9012.hlx3.page/">the HubCitizen project</a>.</p>

<p>the HubCitizen project is like <a href="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/">Humans of New York</a>. I spent time photographing people on the streets and highlighted thier short stories and their lives alongside their portraits, creating a catalogue of the city’s inhabitants.</p>
<p>I built a website by uding a new CMS system called <a href="https://www.hlx.live/">Helix</a>, which allows us to do a content management easily via Google Drive. It is such a powerful tool to build experiences through Google Drive with little-to-no training required, so that website can be edited and updated easily by anyone at WoeLab even after I leave. I have chosen the vertical column structure for easy view. All the codes are publicly shared and accessible on <a href="https://github.com/mariko9012/helix">my Github</a>.</p>
<p>You can watch a summary of what the HubCitizen project is about on the presentation video.</p>
