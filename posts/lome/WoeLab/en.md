# WoeLab

![](woelab.jpeg)

Here I am. I moved to Lomé, the capital city of Togo, Africa!

I'll be working and exploring some of the cities of Africa until the next summer with a talented urbanist and a fantastic co-worker, [Julien Carbonnell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliencarbonnell/?locale=en_US). The initiative I've joined in Togo is called WɔɛLab, created by [Sénamé Koffi A.](https://sename.hubcity.site/), a community-based incubation hub that encourages smart-city development in a local context and educates the local community with digital technology. It's eye-opening to learn what they have achieved here, from creating the first "Made in Africa" 3D printer from e-waste, to tackling plastic-waste issues, to creating a local digital currency system, and urban farming, and beyond. I'll be here until the end of January 2022, until I moved to the next destination, Cameroon.

This is a list of urbanism-related happenings in Lomé. The list will be constantly updated as I discover more.
