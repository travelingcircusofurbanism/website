I'm from Japan, and Tokyo is the city I used to live for years and still keep coming back for work and some fun! 

I occationally update a list of urbanism-related things in Tokyo, but know that the city is constantly changing though, and I can't always update the list.

For those who need more advice on discovering places and conneting with local creatives, you can DM me on [email](mariko9012@gmail.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mariko_urbannomad/?hl=en). I have a lot of inquries on this matter these days, and since it always takes considerable amount of energy and time to tackle each request, a little support is always appriciated. You can donate through the link below.
