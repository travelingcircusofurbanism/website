<p><em>“Amsterdam is in demand, increasing in size by around 11,000 inhabitants per year. The City of Amsterdam wants to facilitate this growth and at the same time reduce pressure on the housing market. By 2025, its goal is to enable the construction of 52,500 homes within the city boundaries”</em> — City of Amsterdam official <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/policy/urban-development/setting-course-2025/" target="_blank" class="external">website</a>.</p>
<p>This article lists some very unique but interesting residential developments along the waterfront which were built only in the last 50 years in the city of Amsterdam. Explore the “new” city development and have a break for a coffee or lunch. It would make you feel like you are part of Amsterdam's upcoming eye opening attractions.</p>
<h3>Places to go, projects to check out</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Borneo Island: A harbour and a docking area have been transformed by urban designers <a href="https://www.west8.com/projects/borneo_sporenburg/" target="_blank" class="external">West 8</a> into a low-rise residential district (1993-2000). Take a walk around the town’s distinctive urban landmark. Check out exciting home facades in Stokerkade street and visit the <a href="http://www.bac-amsterdam.nl/" target="_blank" class="external">BAC Borneo Architectuur Centrum</a> where you will learn about the history of the district and its transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java Island: This district is another harbour renovation project which was turned into a residential area too (1991-2000). You can find multiple small pedestrian bridges stitching the neighbourhood together over the canals full of compact boats. Complete your visit with the viewing of the newly built <a href="https://hoteljakarta.amsterdam/" target="_blank" class="external">Hotel Jakarta</a> designed by Amsterdam based architectural office called <a href="https://www.search.nl/" target="_blank" class="external">Search</a>. Read more about the urban design of Java Island <a href="https://pphp.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/JAVA-ISLAND.pdf" target="_blank" class="external">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funenpark: The neighborhood was a former railway station marshalling yard that was transformed into a new urban quartier in 2011. It is interesting to see how the <a href="http://landezine.com/index.php/2013/02/funenpark-by-landlab/" target="_blank" class="external">urban masterplan</a> integrates the landscape design (by <a href="http://Landlab" target="_blank" class="external">Landlab</a>) and housing blocks and villas by 6 different architectural offices. Take a walk in Czaar Peterbuurt, a small street full of boutiques and coffee places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Houthavens: The former port area is being developed into a residential quartier that is formed by low rise buildings including an iconic high rise building called Pontsteiger. Most of the residential blocks have canal views that resemble traditional Amsterdam house typologies. You can view the site plan at the district's official <a href="https://www.nieuwbouw-houthaven.nl/?gclid=CjwKCAjwpMOIBhBAEiwAy5M6YMnw5luASup0FjdvuL630vw516tfaXkKALGz0tFBCUII7r1dLU0Q7BoCNdAQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" class="external">website</a>. You can stop by at Vessel cafe to observe the waterfront and the ever changing skyline of the “new” Amsterdam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NDSM: Although it is still under construction, the neighborhood is accessible by ferry from Pontsteiger and Central station. During the 19th century, this area was one of the biggest shipyards in the world. It is now being developed into a dense residential area with mixed-use functions. What makes this district unique is the amount of large towers and wide streets profiles. Have a walk in the old shipyard NDSM-werf where you can find many creative local studios. At last, check out the coffee place Noorderlicht, a greenhouse turned into a café with a nice panoramic view over the city!</p>
