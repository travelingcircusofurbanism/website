I wonder if it is possible to do something similar with all the cities around the world.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDzl:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It is the people who make the city.

This is something we have also experienced, where people come and say, ‘just tell us simply what you’re doing,’ or ‘tell me how to become creative.’ But if there are just people sitting there waiting for something to happen, life won’t be brought to the city.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo matter how much creative opportunities and space you provide, nothing will happen unless there is awareness or responsibility from the people involved. In other words, having a spirit of your own and having the spirit of Do-ocracy is important. I think this can be said not only just for Copenhagen but for cities in Japan like Tokyo.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat point.

I would like to really focus on a project for about 3 months and from that I think I would be able to see what’s truly important and a vision for the future.
