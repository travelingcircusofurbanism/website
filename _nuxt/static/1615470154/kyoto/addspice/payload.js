If you are renting a regular apartment through a regular realtor, chances are high that there should not be even a single nail hole on your wall when you move out — that means there is a very little room to play with your creative mind and customize your dream nest in Japan unless you actually own a place.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there has been gradually more and more interesting spots that allow residents and renters to explore new possibilities in where they live and work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe found this listing site called \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fdiyp.jp\u002Fkyoto\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\"\u003EDIYP\u003C\u002Fa\u003E during our research which allows you to check out some DIY-able homes (both for buying and renting).

In Kyoto, however, there aren't many players to connect owners and renters &amp; buyers in a non-conventional way. It's also hard to find all the available listenings online in Kyoto — most of them are hidden due to various concerns of the owners.

Most of the realtors wouldn't want to stay involved after they find renters, and architects tend to walk away from responsibility after construction is finished and buildings are done, she says. Her job, however, doesn't stop there. &quot;I am interested in how things would evolve even after a lease is signed.&quot; That is why her title is a real estate &quot;planner&quot;, who is not merely an agent for the sale, but as a producer and dreamer to help the potentials to grow in the city.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy Kyoto and what's special about it?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a historical city like Kyoto, neighborhood ties and local communities are more noticeable than in big cities like Tokyo.
