A QUARTER of innocent civilians were killed. More than 70 years after the war, the suffering continues. American army forces are here to allow the U.S. to conduct regional security cooperation activities in Japan and in the Far East, and that inevitably involved constant friction with the locals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are curious to know the size of the bases in Okinawa, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Flibguides.gwu.edu\u002Fokinawa\u002Fmilitarybases\u002Fmaps\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\"\u003Ethis is the map\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

In 1945, the United States Navy landed at the port of Chatan, and residents needed to flee. When they came back after the war, the land has drastically transformed with military-related facilities. After the long years of struggles, this part of the land has been returned to the city, and this is when the development that shaped today's Mishima American Village started.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerican village was planned to regenerate local business, by installing commercial and resort facilities with direct access to a beach and a public park. Based on the great location that faces the east china sea and its short distance from the city of Naha, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe unique mix of Japanese and American culture that is specific to this place, their answer was creating an American themed resort and amusement complex.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EUrban development of Okinawa on the land formerly occupied by the U.S. military\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn't it ironic that the local government decided to develop an American theme, their long-lasted enemy? Mihama American Village is commonly considered as a successful development on the formerly occupied land by the U.S. military.
