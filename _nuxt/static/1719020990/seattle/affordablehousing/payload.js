Many people assume that it means low-cost housings. There are many definitions of affordable housing, but the answer is No — at least it's more complicated than that. There are many poorly constructed low-valued housings out there, but if there is no rent regulation, an owner can charge serious price from tenants, and it is not 'affordable' anymore. Instead, affordable housing should involve some public subsidy or other kind of non-profit investment, as well as rent control to cater to a certain section of society whose income is below the median household income.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPlaza Roberto Maestas\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg data-loading=\"\u002Fposts\u002Fseattle\u002Faffordablehousing\u002Ftiny\u002Faffordablehousing01.jpg\" data-src=\"\u002Fposts\u002Fseattle\u002Faffordablehousing\u002Fmed\u002Faffordablehousing01.jpg\" data-pin-url=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.travelingcircusofurbanism.com\u002Fseattle\u002Faffordablehousing\"\ndata-pin-media=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.travelingcircusofurbanism.com\u002Fposts\u002Fseattle\u002Faffordablehousing\u002Flarge\u002Faffordablehousing01.jpg\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we visited \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fbeacondevgroup.com\u002Flocations\u002Fplaza-roberto-maestas\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\"\u003EPlaza Roberto Maestas\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which is a landmark of equitable, community-inspired, transit-oriented development project in the heart of the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Seattle.
