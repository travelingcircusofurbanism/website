That’s because, by their very nature, landmarks are unique and easily distinguishable from their surroundings. What do people think about when they think of Paris? The Eiffel Tower, of course. London? Big Ben. New York City? The Statue of Liberty.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen people ask me about an iconic landmark in Melbourne, the first place that comes into my mind is State Library Victoria (SLV).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMelbourne’s Landmarks\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, Melbourne has other iconic landmarks like Flinders Street Station or the St. Patrick’s Cathedral, but SLV is especially meaningful to me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is Australia’s oldest public library and one of the first free public libraries in the world. The SLV’s La Trobe Reading Room, shown in the picture above, is my #1 favorite writing spot in Greater Melbourne (#2 is a cafe called Guild, which technically is also within the library’s precinct). I go there at least once a week, even though it’s not particularly close to where I live.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe library’s architecture is distinctive, which makes it a perceivable landmark. But it’s not just an architectural exhibit. It’s also a building with a function — a public space designed for the purpose of reading, writing, and exchanging ideas. And I think it does its job quite well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EUnintended Usage\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I found it interesting and funny that it also attracts other forms of usage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the library’s courtyard, for example, there are two sets of human-sized chess boards. Every other afternoon, you can see some older men engaged in an intense chess match, and somehow they always have spectators watching.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a staircase not too far from the chess boards, you can often see a bunch of kids doing ollies and pop shuvits with their skateboards. Not sure why they chose to skate there, but that stark contrast between “library” and “skateboarding” makes you wonder, doesn’t it?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther down, on the sidewalk, some days you’ll find street musicians playing their tunes. And on the grass and benches scattered around there, ordinary citizens like you and me are chatting, having snacks, feeding birds, or whatever activity it is people do in public spaces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPeople Vote with Their Feet\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERenowned urbanist \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fthe-urban-condition\u002Fhumans-of-urbanism-holly-whyte-30bfe3f7585e\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\"\u003EHolly Whyte\u003C\u002Fa\u003E once said that people vote with their feet. They use places that are comfortable and easy to use — and that’s not always in line with the place’s intended function.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, a library’s primary users might be readers and writers. But being a public space, it is available to all sorts of people, and each one of them views the library differently. To a skater, it looks like a skatepark; and to a musician, it’s a stage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIs that a bad thing? On paper, maybe it is. With all the planning and investment that goes into building the library, of course, they want it to be used as it’s intended to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut in reality, all these activities add color to the library’s atmosphere. As long as they are managed, and don’t disturb the library’s primary function, I think they’re fine. It is a renowned landmark in the city’s center, after all, no wonder it attracts such a vibrant and diverse demographic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EImage vs Experience\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a long day of reading and writing, I like to wind down in the library’s courtyard and watch people do their thing. The chess players, the skaters, the musicians, even the bystanders and passers-by. People-watching is Holly Whyte’s favorite pastime, and as an aspiring urbanist, I do have a predisposition towards it as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy watching how people use public spaces, we can understand how to design them better — not just to design how it looks like as an iconic landmark, but how it’s actually used as a space. When designed correctly, a landmark can be more than an element in a city’s image, but also a seamless part of a city’s experience. To me, that’s what State Library Victoria embodies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EPart II: Istanbul\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EHumble Connections, Good Bread\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pillowy scent of yeast and bread billows out from the wooden frame of Cihangir Tarihi Fırını in Istanbul, Turkey. &quot;Cihangir Historical Oven,&quot; as the name translates, began in 1920 as a family business of Rum minorities.

The bakery is the only business in the area open twenty-four hours a day, attracting ebbs and flows of hungry patrons with its ceaseless activity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EGentle Universalities\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThose who come to Cihangir Historical Oven arrive with the same goal in mind: to fill their bellies with the warmth of fresh baked goods. The universality of hunger, of a midnight craving, is validated by the accessibility of a 2-lira treat, regardless of time. Biscuits, simit (sesame-covered bagels), rolls, cookies, and loaves are fresh-made to fill bellies inclusive of gender, class, race, sexuality, ethnicity, and religion. Delicious.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn elderly man sits at the closest table from the door.
