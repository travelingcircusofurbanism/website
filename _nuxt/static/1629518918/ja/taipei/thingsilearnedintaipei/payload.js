We do not want to take everything happened in daily life for granted. Therefore, we seize the moments that glitter in the intervals of time before they are gone as a way to show our gratitude for the land. Literature and photography are the approaches we use to interpret what we see in daily life. Thus, experiences are individual-oriented and rather subjective. Taipei West Town expects itself as short take. We record and interpret the struggles and perseverance of the old town with a great patience to see the chemical reaction in this experiment.

At night, one might accidentally come across the historical site in the red brick alley. We use West Town as our name, Taipei as starting point, and the story we share is the story about Taiwanese. Taipei West Town will keep recording ordinary stories that happen in this humid city. We sincerely invite the lost-in-city readers to walk into the daily life of Taipei like an insider, be amazed by the city’s prosperity, and might also express in wonder unconsciously, “Umm, now I realized that there is also some ways to live in Taipei.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFriendly guidebook contains numerous spots in the old town, we only recommend because we are moved by these places.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline private tour guide in three languages (Chinese\u002F English\u002F Japanese), sending messages to the world\u003Cbr\u003E\nConnect you to the right person and local organization that are perfect for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EShintomicho Cultural Market\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EBeauty of walking and observing\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECity observation club\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETaipei West Town too?\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAlexandlar\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ECitizen Participation\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWay to Community\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMorgen and Clement\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ECircular Economy\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOpen Pen\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EREnato\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFermnet the City and Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab (C-LAB)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELast but no least — Morgane Le Guilloux &amp; Clément Tricot\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Furbantaiouan.com\u002F?s=ta\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\"\u003EUrban Tai-ouan\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUrban Journalism fellows who\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Eun-cotegorized:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eindonecia neigouhood\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n","台北の街づくりの現場から学んだこと",false,true)));
