It's the largest city in Cameroon and its economic capital, while Yanoudé is more about administrative center. It about 230 km south from Yaoundé, and has a large indrtsrial port and an international airport.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I absoltely got overwhelmed by the toasty weather and cramped streets packed with people and cars, I loved it every single minute I spent in it, thanks to the wonderful encounters I had in some of the art &amp; design spaces there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EI arrived in Douala in a late evening. I was exhausted, a bit tired of the new envoronment, and didn't know where to go out for dinner.

Once I finally found a way to the entrance, I immidietely knew that I would even live there.

It's a welcoming space with satisfying yet not exchauting amount of collections, mainly by emerging African artists. People were welcoming too, and I am glad to be able to speak with one of the curators, who tought us other art spaces to visit in the city. Without her reccomendation, my stay in Douala wouldn't have been the same at all.

They told me everything about thier work, thier space, thier philosophy, over a glass of fresh juice they offered, and we spoke briefly about African feminism, politics and identities of the non-west.
