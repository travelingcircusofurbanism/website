The way civilization develops will influence and be influenced by the cities we live in, and our fate as a species will inevitably go along with it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUrban planning gives us a way to affect this process in a way that benefits us. As Jane Jacobs said, humans make cities, and it is humans that cities must cater to — because, as we shape our cities, they will shape us in return. And we want to make sure they’ll shape us the right way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis human-centric approach to urban planning seems obvious at first, but it really isn’t. If we only look at the recent history of human civilization, we’ll see that often the central subject in urban planning is not humans. Instead, it’s tall buildings and automobiles. The evidence for this is clear in many places: Capitalistic interests often outweigh humanistic interests.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGranted, things are starting to change. But it took us several decades to see the wrong in our ways, and therefore, often the most challenging problem that urban planners need to solve — to put bluntly — is “fixing the mistakes of our predecessors” instead of “starting from the ground-up.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanning for expedience doesn’t work anymore. It’s like trading the future for the present. Instead, we must plan for sustainability, as advocated by the UN through their \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fsdgs.un.org\u002Fgoals\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\"\u003E17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\u003C\u002Fa\u003E — so we can leave boons, not banes, for our successors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPlan residential areas so everyone has access to housing. Plan commercial zones so economic activities benefit all parties. Plan transportation networks so people can traverse their city with ease. Plan green spaces so the environment and humans can thrive in coexistence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPlan everything. Bring utopia as close to reality as possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is the raison d’être of urban planning — oversimplified. As we’ve established before, urban planning solutions are rarely simple. Reality is always more complicated than we’d like it to be, even more so with gargantuan entities like cities. There will always be compromises to make. There will always be imperfections we have to live with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the task futile, then? No, not exactly. Urban planning is not a fool’s errand. If it is, we wouldn’t have beautiful urbanscapes like London and Paris. We wouldn’t have majestic metropolises like Tokyo, Sydney, and New York. Not even peaceful capitals like Oslo and Copenhagen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese cities are by no means perfect. They have flaws, both slight and striking — but still, in their existence, we can observe tangible proof that urban planning works, and that it is a fight worth getting into.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion: Humanity vs Urbanity\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECities are now the most human place on earth. The statistics don’t lie, and yet, some people may argue that cities are humane in numbers only, not in character. Urban dwellers are materialistic and individualistic, they say — but that’s oversimplifying, and again, anything oversimplified is seldom true.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite all the negative traits associated with cities, humans are drawn to them. We keep marching toward cities, settle down in their corners, and call them home. This is a worldwide and species-specific trend. Humankind and cities go hand-in-hand. Or, at least, they’re supposed to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that’s the mission: Making sure they go hand-in-hand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the importance of urban planning cannot be overstated. In the beginning, we shape cities. We plan, design, and develop them to fit our image. But in the long run, our cities shape us. Our houses decide how we live. Our streets affect how we walk. Our parks influence how we play.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver time, our cities form who we are: Our identity, personality, even our emotions. As long as humankind lives in cities, they will become part of us, both as individuals and as a species. The relationship between humanity and urbanity doesn’t have to be antagonistic. We can make it symbiotic instead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanning cities means planning the fate of our species, and it takes tremendous wisdom to carry out that Herculean (or even Sisyphean) task.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs said by Socrates the philosopher:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E“By far the greatest and most admirable form of wisdom is that needed to plan and beautify cities and human communities.”\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUrban planners, your work matters.
